## ⚡ VendingMachine - Digital Design

VendingMachine is a digital design project implemented in **VHDL**, focusing on simulating the behavior of an automated vending system. The design models item selection, coin insertion, change calculation, and product dispensing through modular hardware components.


## 📌 Project Description

This project represents a modular **vending machine system** using VHDL. It simulates a real-world vending process where a user can insert coins, select products, and receive either the product or change depending on the balance. The repository serves as an **educational demonstration** of applying digital design principles to model a **finite state machine (FSM)** for vending logic.


## 📚 Used Modules

🔄 **Finite State Machine (FSM)** - Controls the overall vending process (idle, waiting for coins, dispensing, giving change)  
💰 **Coin Input Module** - Accepts and validates inserted coins  
🛒 **Product Selection Module** - Handles product requests from the user  
📖 **Price & Balance Register** - Tracks inserted money and compares it with product price  
⚖️ **Comparator Module** - Determines if enough balance exists for product dispensing  
📤 **Dispensing Unit** - Delivers the selected product when conditions are met  
💵 **Change Return Module** - Returns excess coins if balance exceeds product price  
🧪 **Testbench** - Provides simulation scenarios to verify vending machine behavior  


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

📜 **VHDL** - Hardware description and system design  
🧩 **Simulation Tools** - ModelSim / Vivado (for testing and verifying behavior)
